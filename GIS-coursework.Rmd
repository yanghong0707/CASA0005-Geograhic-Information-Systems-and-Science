## Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Crime
This research aims to better understand the impacts of the coronavirus-related social restriction on crime. 

# Part 1: Loading data of COVID-19 
It is simple to load CSV file by R
```{r}
# loading the CSV file of covid-19 
Covid_19_cases<- read.csv("data/cases_london by month.csv",
                          header = TRUE,
                          sep = ",",
                          encoding = "latin1")
```

This CSV file was downloaded from London Datastore. URL:https://data.london.gov.uk/download/coronavirus--covid-19--cases/151e497c-a16e-414e-9e03-9e428f555ae9/phe_cases_london_boroughs.csv 

The data have been processed by Excel. I create a PivotTable by selecting boroughs as rows. As for columns, I calculated the total number of cases monthly

Then I plot the bar charts of covid-19 to check their distributions.
```{r}
# selecting columns'month'
month<-factor(Covid_19_cases$month,levels=Covid_19_cases$month)
# After plotting, I find the x-axis placing in alphabetical orderï¼Œ rather than time series. So I use  'levels=Covid_19_cases$month' to make the order correctly.
number1_covid<-(Covid_19_cases$total_cases)/1000
# Resize the number of cases
df1<-data.frame(month,number1_covid)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df1,aes(month,number1_covid))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="steelblue")+
  # setting the labels
  labs(title = 'Total COVID-19 Cases in London by Month', x = 'month', y = 'monthly counts, London*1000' )+
  # adding the title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20,colour = "black",hjust = 0.5))
```

I also plotting the confirmed cases by boroughs
```{r}
Covid_cases<- read.csv("data/cases_london by boroughs.csv",
                          header = TRUE,
                          sep = ",",
                          encoding = "latin1")
#selecting the borough names and the confirmed number
boroughs_name1<-factor(Covid_cases$area_name,levels=Covid_cases$area_name)
number2_covid<-Covid_cases$total_cases
df2<-data.frame(number2_covid,boroughs_name1)
ggplot(df2,aes(number2_covid,boroughs_name1))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="steelblue")+
  labs(title = 'Total COVID-19 Cases by Boroughs up to 30/11/2020', x = 'number of cases', y = 'boroughs name' )+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20,colour = "black",hjust = 0.5))
```

I focuse on the accumulative value in last day

# Part 2: Loading the information about London boroughs

It is simple to read shapefile in R
```{r}
library(sf)
LondonBorough <- st_read(here::here("data",
                                    "statistical-gis-boundaries-london",
                                    "ESRI",
                                    "London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp"))
```

This CSV file was downloaded from London Datastore. URL:https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip

# Part 3: Load data of crime
```{r}
Crimes<- read.csv("data/MPS Ward Level Crime_edit.csv",
                  header = TRUE,
                  sep = ",",
                  encoding = "latin1")
```
This CSV file was downloaded from London Datastore.URL:https://data.london.gov.uk/download/recorded_crime_summary/d2e9ccfc-a054-41e3-89fb-53c2bc3ed87a/MPS%20Borough%20Level%20Crime%20%28most%20recent%2024%20months%29.csv

The data have been processed by Excel.I create a PivotTable by selecting boroughs as rows. As for columns, we just focus on ten major categories and record monthly. And I also create a new column called total cases which is the sum of offences in each borough.

# Part 4: Merging dataframe and connect to map
```{r}
#merge by common column
covid_crimes=merge(Covid_cases,Crimes,by.x="area_code",by.y="area_code")
# then put the covid_crime data into the map,  using the function of 'left_join' 
library(tidyverse)
LondonBoroughcases <- LondonBorough%>%
  left_join(.,
            covid_crimes,
            by = c("GSS_CODE" = "area_code"))
```

NOW, we can plot the map
```{r}
# checking the information about covid-19
g = ggplot(LondonBoroughcases) +
  # filled by the number of covid-19 cases
  geom_sf(aes(fill = total_cases)) +
  #choosing the patette of 'spectral'
  scale_fill_distiller("total_cases", palette = "Spectral") +
  ggtitle("covid_19_cases by boroughs")
g

#checking the information about crime
f = ggplot(LondonBoroughcases) +
  # filled by the number of crime cases
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Crime_cases)) +
  #choosing the patette of 'spectral'
  scale_fill_distiller("total_cases", palette = "Spectral") +
  ggtitle("Crime_cases by boroughs")
f
```

# Part 5: The structure breaks
```{r}
#loading data
Break_points<- read.csv("data/MPS Ward Level Crime_breakpoint.csv",
               header = TRUE,
               sep = ",",
               encoding = "latin1")
```
